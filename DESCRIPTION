Depends: R (>= 3.0.1), penalized, Iso, survival
Description: This package allows the use of multiple sources of co-data (e.g. external p-values, gene lists, annotation) to improve prediction of binary, continuous and survival response using (logistic, linear or Cox) group-regularized ridge regression. It also facilitates post-hoc variable selection and prediction diagnostics by cross-validation using ROC curves and AUC.
