Description: This package allows the use of multiple sources of co-data (e.g. external p-values, gene lists, annotation) to improve prediction of binary and continuous response using (logistic) group-regularized ridge regression. It also facilitates post-hoc variable selection and prediction diagnostics by cross-validation using ROC curves and AUC.
